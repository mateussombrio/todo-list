# About
The idea is to create a TODO list using HTML, CSS and JS, but without using frameworks.

# Update
I created a simple TODO list using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a search function, the ability to add and delete tasks, and a checkbox to indicate whether a task is completed or not.

The project took me some time to complete because there were topics I wasn't very familiar with, such as functions calling other functions to use their local variables, DOM manipulation, and the logic behind constructing the features.

Despite being a simple project, I learned a lot.
