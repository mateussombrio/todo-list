# About
The idea is to create a TODO list using HTML, CSS and JS, but without using frameworks.

# Update
I created a simple TODO list with HTML, CSS and JS. It have a search, enter and delete task and a checkbox that says if the task if completed or not. The project took me some time to be concluded, because there was topics that I was not so familiar with i.e (functions calling other functions so I could use their local variables, DOM manipulation and the logic behind constructin the features).

Despite been a simple project, I learned a lot.
